# Iceberg

## Why the name Iceberg?

Well that's what happened whe I thought of this project:

```
Tech Interview Platform -> TIP -> Tip of the iceberg -> Iceberg!
```

So.. Yep!

## Why make an technical interview platform?

There is already tools out there, but they are often bundled up with other services. The goal of Iceberg is to be free to use. Spin a server to host it and you're good to go!
